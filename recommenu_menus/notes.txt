I have ratings, but since there are multiple locations the ratins have different id's
- so I need to get each chickfil, then match items of each and have those ranked

- need to make a list of restaurants that have fsid with menus, then need to go and get those ratings from yelp
	- to make sure that I have ratings for every 'chickfila'

- going to need to see if 'chickfila' has one working menu - if not put on list of 'nonexistant menus'
